This stuff is all available as part of the tu-testbed project on
SourceForge; http://sourceforge.net/projects/tu-testbed

If you're looking for demos, there should be .bat files or scripts in
this dir, to start them.  Or not.  See below for info on specific
demos...

See the text files in docs/ for more info about the project.

Chunked LOD
===========

If you downloaded a Chunked LOD demo, you can use the
"go_chunklod.bat" script in this directory to start it.  The code and
executables should be in "demos/chunklod".

GameSWF
=======

If you downloaded a GameSWF demo, look for an executable at
"gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.exe".  Run it with the name of a Flash file
(e.g. "gameswf_test_ogl.exe some_movie.swf") and hopefully it will
render the file.
